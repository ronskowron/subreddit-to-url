# Subreddit to URL

If Reddit wasn't open and I wanted to go to a specific subreddit, I thought it was tedious to type "r/subreddit" into the address bar, then click the top link. So I thought "How can I make this easier?" 

I made this extension to combat this! A user can type their desired subreddit in the address bar i.e. r/askreddit, and it will just take them right to the sub.

**Tested with these search engines:**
* Google
* Yahoo
* Bing
* Ask

## Future Goals
* Search subreddits through the address bar
* Actually add it to the extension marketplace
* Think of a better name
